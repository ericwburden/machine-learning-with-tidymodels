# About {#chapter-1}

_Machine Learning with TidyModels_ is the result of my desire to gain a foundational
understanding of machine learning and machine learning techniques _without_ 
overcomplicating the process by wrestling with the huge variety of models and 
modeling packages available in the R ecosystem. The promise of the `tidymodels`
meta-package is a unified interface for preparing data, training models, and
leveraging the results. I find this to be an eminently sensible approach and see
in `tidymodels` an opportunity to let the software "get out of the way" and let
me focus on the ML algorithms themselves. For me, this book serves as a training
exercise. I hope that, when finished, it will serve as a valuable reference.
