## Introduction

This project serves as the source for the _Machine Learning with `tidymodels`_ 
book, which is an attempt to compile information from multiple sources into a 
single "how-to" for performing a number of different ML techniques in the
`tidymodels` style. This book serves as a primer for both the underlying
ML models and the `tidymodels` approach to leveraging these models. While this
book is not intended to be an exhaustive treatment of all the covered topics, I
do plan to go into some depth in order to increase my own understanding.
