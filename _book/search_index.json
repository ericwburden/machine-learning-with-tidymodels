[["index.html", "Machine Learning with TidyModels Chapter 1 About 1.1 Software Used", " Machine Learning with TidyModels Eric Burden 2022-10-14 Chapter 1 About Machine Learning with TidyModels is the result of my desire to gain a foundational understanding of machine learning and machine learning techniques without overcomplicating the process by wrestling with the huge variety of models and modeling packages available in the R ecosystem. The promise of the tidymodels meta-package is a unified interface for preparing data, training models, and leveraging the results. I find this to be an eminently sensible approach and see in tidymodels an opportunity to let the software “get out of the way” and let me focus on the ML algorithms themselves. For me, this book serves as a training exercise. I hope that, when finished, it will serve as a valuable reference. 1.1 Software Used This book was developed with version 4.2.1 of the R language and version 1.0.0 of the tidymodels meta-package.
